Welcome to Pseudo-Scrabble.
Type "help" for instructions.
>>> 
Play Pseudo-Scrabble by repeatedly making moves. To make a move, place any
number of letters on the blank spaces of this board, then submit the move. If
the move is valid, then the move will be saved to the board and a score counter
will increment. If the move is not valid, then the move is not saved and the
player has the option to revert the board to the previous successful move.

To place a letter on the board, run the "place" command specifying a single
letter, and a valid row number and column number indicating the location of
placement. Rows and columns are one-indexed (e.g. the first row is row 1,
and row 0 does not exist).

A valid move meets the following criteria:
- Letters must be played in a straight line, up-down or left-right.
- The first word can be played anywhere on the board.
- All subsequent words must share at least one space with an existing word.
- Word direction can be left-to-right or top-to-bottom.
- All sets of adjacent letters must form valid words.
