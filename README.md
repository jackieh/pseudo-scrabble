Pseudo-Scrabble
===============

Interact with a pseudo-Scrabble board via a command line REPL.

### Current state

The command line front-end and board back-end are code-complete. Various bugs
have been found and are being fixed.

### Dependencies

- C++17

- Boost

- (GNU Aspell)[http://aspell.net/]

### Building and running

To build both an executable binary and a library for interfacing with the
pseudo-scrabble board directly, run `make`. To run the command line interface,
simply run the `pseudoscrabble` executable and type `help` for instructions.
